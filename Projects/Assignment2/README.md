Assignment 2: Stereoscopic Viewing
==================================

![Stereoscopic Viewing Example](https://media.giphy.com/media/kyEcqI86iqbdSEaVd6/giphy.gif)

This project utilizes the same code base from Assignment 1, however, it was modified so that the scene is rendered in a stereoscopic view.

Controls
========

"VirtualTrackBall.cpp" and "VirtualTrackBall.h" contain the implementation for the trackball motion that effects the camera. When
the user clicks the left button of the mouse, they can then drag and rotate the camera around in space. For keyboard input, here
are all of the possible user controls:

* A: Rotate the camera towards the left
* D: Rotate the camera towards the right
* W: Move the camera forwards
* S: Move the camera backwards
