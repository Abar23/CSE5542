Project Description:
This project implements Boids algorithm using WebGL and WebVR. Currently, this project is publicly hosted online
at go.osu.edu/duck_hunt. 

Project Functionalities Checklist:
1. Utilize low level WebGL to implement Boids algorithm

2. Integrate WebVR into the completed WebGL code

3. Design Visuals for the project. Achieved with Duck Hunt theme
	a. Created low level WebGL animation system
	b. Created texture atlases for sprite artwork

4. Increased performance of Boids algorithm
	a. Desktop or laptop can introduce around 400 to 500 boids into the scene before slow downs occur
	b. Varies on mobile devices, however, it should be roughly the same on newer phone models

5. Can use Google Cardboard for VR state of the program.

Technical issues:
1. Does not work in iPhone due to WebGL 2.0 limitations set on Apple devices.
